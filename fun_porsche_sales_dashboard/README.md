# ðŸš— Driving Data with Power BI â€” Porsche Sales Dashboard

A fun, fictional Porsche sales dataset turned into an interactive 2024 dashboard to sharpen my Power BI skills.

## Porsche Car Sales Dashboard (Fictional Dataset)

A Power BI project I built to practice dashboard design and interactivity.  
The dataset is **fully fictional**, simulating 2024 sales for 3 Porsche models.

### Key features:
- Sales analysis by month, region, and customer  
- Profit and budget tracking  
- Interactive bookmarks & slicers  
- Custom visuals for each car model  

This project was all about experimenting with **data storytelling** and learning how to control slicer interactions in Power BI.
